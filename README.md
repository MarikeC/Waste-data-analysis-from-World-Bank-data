## Waste data analysis based on waste data published by the World Bank (What a Waste Global Database)

This project was presented in April 2020 as my final project for All Women Data Science Bootcamp.

Original datasets can be downloaded here: https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/what-waste-global-database

These datasets count of 2 series: one about cities and another one about countries. 

It has been a very enlightning project with some disappointment when cleaning the data:
- Contrary to what is stated on the WB database web page, these data sets are not time series and therefore do not allow you to predict the time,
- The majority of variables have a very high percentage of missing information and therefore cannot be considered statistically relevant,
- The dataset of cities is not representative of the global economic and geographic distribution.

That being said, the remaining information was not numerous but it allowed me to draw basic conclusion about
the relationship between GDP and waste generation and the unsustainability of our economic system.
